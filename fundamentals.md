## Applications
Brief history from ELIZA to Siri  
Machine translation, search, dialogue, machine translation, spam filtering, recommendations, spelling correction, sentiment analysis  

## Tasks and Progress
segmentation, tokenisation, stemming, tagging, parsing, clustering, classification, named-entity recognition, summarisation, natural language generation, language identification, anaphora resolution  

[spaCy demos](https://explosion.ai/demos/) - parsing

mixed tasks: image captioning eg [@picdescbot](https://twitter.com/picdescbot), CLEVR, speech recognition / synthesis, product recommendations

metrics: BLEU, ...

state of the art: [AI Index](https://aiindex.org/) 2017 report

## Approaches  
The basic building blocks that are re-used in many approaches:  
pre-processing, n-grams, TF-IDF, interlingua, parallel corpora...
