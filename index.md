Recent progress in machine learning for natural language is significant, however language poses some unique challenges.

In this class we will start with natural language processing **fundamentals** and the current results of state-of-the-art approaches across tasks.  We will focus on **deep learning** – the motivations behind word vectors and sequence output, and how to apply effective approaches to real tasks with industrial-strength libraries and datasets, which we will practice in the **lab**.

We will also keep in view how natural language tasks relate to tasks in other areas of machine learning.
